# Sample Text, Introduction (W.I.P)

Red Green Blue (RGB) is the lowest level observed within both classical and contemporary Test Driven Development (TDD). It’s the process of fail, suffice, refactor.
 When applied properly, development is a loop that starts with criteria,  and ends with features. When we all start learning to develop without aim, there are many things that can clutter the mind, such as regressive issues, that will grind productivity to a halt. These issues can be prevented and it all starts with the familiar colors:
Red, Green, and Blue.

Red might describe rejection, criticism, or failure. These are the worst parts of development, but they prove critical. In TDD, red describes the step of setting tests, that must fail, before adding new features. This verifies that nothing stands against the tasks of new features, an ultimate task list — if you will.
In layman’s terms, criteria defines development objectives, and when cultivated before production of features it eliminates wasteful or excessive code, demands modularity, and naturally proctors future refactoring — all without regressive issues.
