Red Green Blue - Test Driven Development
## Purpose
Red Green Blue describes the three state loop in which software is developed. As a hobbyist software developer, I've spent almost a decade honing the craft and reading many books on the subject.
The use of colors is to create a mental imagery of the lowest loop in TDD, fail - suffice - refactor.

## Audience
The book is written for those who may know nothing about tests, and hopes to provide that eureka moment for anyone with absolutely passion for programming.
