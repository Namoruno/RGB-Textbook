# RGB-Textbook
Red Green Blue - Test Driven Development

### Purpose
Red Green Blue describes the three state loop in which software is developed. As a hobbyist software developer, I've spent almost a decade honing the craft and reading many books on the subject, with the sub-genre is under-saturated I decided to create an entry level textbook.
The use of colors describes the mental imagery of the lowest loop in TDD, fail - suffice - refactor.

### Audience
The book is written for those unfamiliar with tests, and also provides for anyone in the uncertain shoes of solo development.

### About the author
I'm Roman, an aspiring author from Virginia (USA) and enthusiast of many disciplines. I've most fondly spent my time developing software, particularly plugins and features that coinside with existing solutions. In that specific realm of software development, one is typically creating very modular and highly utile solutions -- which ultimately requires **testing**! In my pursuit for knowledge on 'clean code', I had found Test Driven Development -- and have since read a few books on the matter. Tests have become my non-negotiable for software development, and as it comes for the future it's the perfect way to utilize A.I.! I'm excited to declare this book to enter peer review, and open suggestions, by fall 2026!

## Sample, Introduction.
Red Green Blue (RGB) is the lowest level observed within both classical and contemporary Test Driven Development (TDD). It’s the process of fail, suffice, refactor. When applied properly, development is a loop that starts with criteria, and ends with features. When we all start learning to develop without aim, there are many things that can clutter the mind, such as regressive issues, that will grind productivity to a halt. These issues can be prevented and it all starts with the familiar colors: Red, Green, and Blue.

### ~ Red ~ 
Red might describe rejection, criticism, or failure. These are the worst parts of development, but they prove critical. In TDD, red describes the step of setting tests, that must fail, before adding new features. This verifies that nothing stands against the tasks of new features, an ultimate task list — if you will. In layman’s terms, criteria defines development objectives, and when cultivated before production of features it eliminates wasteful or excessive code, demands modularity, and naturally proctors future refactoring — all without regressive issues.
