### Purpose
Red Green Blue describes the three state loop in which software is developed. As a hobbyist software developer, I've spent almost a decade honing the craft and reading many books on the subject, with the entry-level books in Test Driven Development being heavily under-saturated, I decided to create my own textbook.
The use of colors describes the mental imagery of the lowest loop in TDD, fail - suffice - refactor.

### Audience
The book is written for those unfamiliar with tests, and also provides for anyone in the uncertain shoes of solo development.

### About the author
I'm Roman, an aspiring author from Virginia (USA) - and enthusiast of many disciplines. In a quote of my own, that "if nothing is important to you, nothing is important about you". I've most fondly spent my time developing software, particularly plugins and features that coinside with existing solutions. In that specific realm of software development, one is typically creating very modular -- and highly utile -- solutions. Ultimately this requires **testing**! In my pursuit for knowledge on 'clean code', I had found Test Driven Development -- and have since read a few books on the matter. Tests have assumed non-negotiable importance in my software developments, and as it comes for the future, it's the perfect way to utilize A.I.! I'm excited to declare this book to enter peer review, and open suggestions, by fall 2026!

## What’s with the colors?
Red Green Blue (RGB) is the lowest ‘loop’ observed within both classical and contemporary Test Driven Development (TDD). It’s the process of fail, suffice, refactor.
 When applied properly, development is a loop that starts with criteria,  and ends with features. There are many things that can clutter the mind, such as regressive issues, that will grind productivity to a halt. These issues can be prevented and it all starts with the familiar colors; Red, Green, and Blue. 
Though testing at it’s core is simple, it proves difficult for beginning developers to pick up. It’s not like we’re teaching anyone to test their “Hello World” programs, and why would we, but it begs the question of where on the road map tests become imperative. Within traditional collegiate study,  it’s often further neglected without a single dedicated textbook 4 year plans. A mere section of a textbook can go without finding itself on a final exam, it’s study guide, or the slides a teacher presents in class — which results in significantly delayed utilization of TDD.
